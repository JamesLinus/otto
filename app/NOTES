initially used Apple's py2applet tool thus:/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/Extras/bin/py2applet --make-setup Otto.py


installing a local version of python for py2app to bundle up in an app:

(be sure to unset any custom LD_* and DYLD_* env variables or you might have build problems.)

# https://gist.github.com/pithyless/1208841
$ brew install --universal readline sqlite gdbm
$ brew install python --universal --framework

$ cd /usr/local
$ virtualenv otto
$ cd otto
  # edit bin/activate and change VIRTUAL_ENV="/usr/local/otto" to VIRTUAL_ENV="`pwd`"
$ . activate   # don't confuse this activate with the one in bin/activate
$ brew install --universal libtiff libjpeg webp little-cms2    # libpng too (not needed for Pillow)
  # don't bother with openjpeg, brew installs openjpeg 1.5.1 so it doesn't help Pillow which wants >=2.0
$ pip install -r requirements.pip


if you try to install pyobjc and encounter "'module' object has no attribute '_install_lib'"
it's from pyobjc having lines like "for fn in install_lib._install_lib.get_outputs(self):"
in it's setup.py. setuptools 3.5 changed this and the lines need to be changed to
install_lib.orig.install_lib.get_outputs
this is hard to do as pyobjc is a tree of about 35 packages.
So instead you can edit /usr/local/otto/lib/python2.7/site-packages/setuptools/command/install_lib.py
and add at the top:
  from distutils.command.install_lib import install_lib as _install_lib

modulegraph 0.12 seems to have a bug:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25394320/py2app-modulegraph-missing-scan-code
edit modulegraph.py and replace the three orrcurances of _scan_code with scan_code.

wait! ronald says to use version 0.8: https://bitbucket.org/ronaldoussoren/py2app/issue/149/attributeerror-module-object-has-no
$ pip install modulegraph==0.8    # fixed it, i'm adding it to requirements.pip
probably fixed other issue above too i'm guessing
nope! it's harder than all that. sigh. py2app seems to insist 

went to a newer version of py2app (not sure that helped anything)
$ pip install py2app==0.9 (now that way in requirements.pip)
edited /usr/local/otto/lib/python2.7/site-packages/py2app/recipes/virtualenv.py
  changed scan_code to _scan_code
  changed load_module to _load_module
that made it happy

TypeError: dyld_find() got an unexpected keyword argument 'loader'
https://bitbucket.org/ronaldoussoren/py2app/issue/137/py2app-problems-using-enthought-python
edit lib/python2.7/site-packages/macholib/MachOGraph.py
line 49: change loader=loader.filename to loader_path=loader.filename



there seems to be an issue with python modules socketIO-client and newer versions of the
websocket-client module. it causes Otto.py to endlessly loop while trying to connect to the server.
the readme seems to indicate they changed something in websocket-client 0.14.0 and perhaps that's
what broke things. for now just pip install websocket-client==0.12.0.
