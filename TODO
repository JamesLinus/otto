fix zipfile to unpack correctly on mac (don't use the non-compressed setting)
chat window doesn't always autoscroll
font size off in firefox esp. for chat prompt
chat captures browser meta keys on some browsers
hover in now playing should do both filename and lables at the same time
does time format still have bugs?
what do to about clicking on now playing test
panel resizing has bugs
image resizing/caching is way too slow
stuff not loading in to various, soundtracks, and unknown correctly
rounding bug between song.length and what mpd reports as total time
