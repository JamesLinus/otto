:bugs:
stars for other users don't show in showstars view
v letterbar not being clipped on narrow browser window
v chat output div slightly too wide, long lines make it sideways scrollable
channel list should not be completely rebuilt just by listener changes
inbox on letterbar has extra gap
better formatting of search results
v changing channels is not quite working
v server crashes sometimes when clients reconnect after server restarts (setting focus state etc?)
v app: about box crashes (until assets are cached?)
v app: media keys lockup app on 10.7 (just don't do media keys on 10.7?)
v app: need to get and pass session cookie on Otto.py socket.io connection
app: use output (lineout) status to trigger "listening" on listener list
v? leaving stream too sensitive, esp. in channelbar display
timeout 'typing' in chat window after a sufficent period
v fix zipfile to unpack correctly on mac (don't use the non-compressed setting)
chat window doesn't always autoscroll (might be because of smooth scrolling)
x font size off in firefox esp. for chat prompt (not font size i don't think, div off by 1px up?)
chat captures browser meta keys on some browsers and app (e.g. cmd-q)
what do to about clicking on now playing test
image resizing/caching is way too slow
stuff not loading into various, soundtracks, and unknown correctly
v rounding bug between song.length and what mpd reports as total time (round up instead of down perhaps?)
sound effects seems to be stepping on each other, e.g. chat message alert
log scale on volume slider
v make channelbar hover items disappear after a while (so we have a place to park the cursor on the tv)
don't random pick 'audiobook' or 'podcast' labeled items
audio channel options tray should default open for current channel
audio channel options tray needs a different icon (i in circil? gear?)
clicking on channel should switch to listening to it in local (lineout) mode
need 'crossfade' subpression option/checkbox for channels
seeking is scaled wrong in TV mode (it's 'doubled') stars too
bug when listener changes name (extranious 'unknown' listener stays listed until refresh)
v /nick in chat should change username
.eventually need to seperate chat nick name from username so people can have a choice
grid background messes up on scroll (only in app and only on initial load page!)
stars layout problems in a number of places (expand album view, search results, more...)
search results has major layout problems
for songs missing an image, use first image found in album
remember size setting (cookie? or local storage?)
is unknown filed in ...? should it be (i can't remember if i did this on purpose)
app seems to have css problems on the second initial load page
don't put a black background behind album images (see shaped picture disc example on will's otto)
clear emptydatabase flag earlier in load process (so you can point a browser at it while it's still doing the initial load)?
odd big gap between owner and file in queue
just use orig sized image instead of 600x600 (and don't generate and store 600x600 images)
make TV mode one of the -/+ sizes
logging out leaves things active on letter bar (and there are prob. other things that need to be reset too)
. need to reprocess stars on login
clicking on album name or artist name in now play renders .browserresults w/o "otto" logo footer
make "otto" footer only appear when there are .browserresults (and maybe only when they require scrolling down?)
perhaps clicking on 'otto' logo at bottom should shoot to to the top of page?
add "x" to search box to dismiss search results
queue updates need to be split between now playing and queue changes to prevent blinking
click on landscape doesn't reset cubes
